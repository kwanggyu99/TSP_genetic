# TSP Problem Optimization

This repository contains implementations to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using two different approaches:
1. **Search-Based Optimization**: A traditional method utilizing heuristic and exhaustive search techniques.
2. **Genetic Algorithm + Reinforcement Learning**: A hybrid approach combining genetic algorithms with reinforcement learning to find optimized solutions.

The goal of this project is to compare these methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.
